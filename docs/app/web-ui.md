# Web UI Guide

The Tasks web interface provides a dashboard for monitoring and managing the platform.

## Accessing the UI

Start Tasks with the `--web` flag:

```bash
cargo run -- run --web
```

Open your browser to `http://localhost:4800`.

## Navigation

The main navigation includes:

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Dashboard** | System overview and statistics |
| **Tasks** | Task list with filtering and details |
| **Merge Queue** | Review and approve pending changes |
| **Orchestrator** | AI project foreman feed and chat |
| **Events** | Real-time event log viewer |

## Dashboard

The dashboard provides an at-a-glance view of:

- **Operating Mode** - Current mode (Play/Pause/Stop)
- **Active Tasks** - Number of tasks in progress
- **Pending Reviews** - Merge queue items awaiting approval
- **Recent Activity** - Latest events across all tasks
- **Escalations** - Up to 5 recent orchestrator escalation events with task context

### Changing Mode

Click the mode indicator to switch between:

- **Play** - Full autonomy
- **Pause** - Agents work, merges paused
- **Stop** - All activity halted

## Tasks View

### Task List

Tasks are grouped by state and sorted by priority. Each row shows:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Priority | Up/right/down arrow (high/medium/low) or dash |
| ID | GitHub issue/PR number, or short task ID for internal tasks |
| State | Colored icon indicating current state |
| Title | Task title |
| Labels | GitHub labels |
| Project | Repository name |
| Updated | Last activity time |

Tasks with `changes_requested` state appear at the top — they have higher dispatch priority than waiting tasks.

### Creating a Task

Use the **New Task** button to create a GitHub issue directly from the UI without leaving Tasks. Select a project, enter a title and optional description (Markdown), and add labels. The poller picks up the new issue on its next cycle.

### Filtering

Use the header tabs to filter tasks by lifecycle:

| Tab | Shows |
|-----|-------|
| **All** | Every task |
| **Active** | Running, waiting, blocked, testing, in merge queue, conflict |
| **Done** | Completed, failed, cancelled |

Use the **search box** to filter by title or task ID within the current tab.

### Task Detail

Click a task to view its detail page. The detail view is split into tabs:

| Tab | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| **Chat** | Send messages to the active agent session |
| **Details** | Full task description (Markdown rendered) |

A **Properties** sidebar on the right shows metadata (state, project, created date) and the task event timeline.

## Merge Queue

The merge queue shows PRs awaiting human review.

### Entry States

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Pending** | Awaiting review |
| **Approved** | Ready to merge |
| **Rejected** | Declined |
| **Changes Requested** | Needs modification before merging |

### Actions

For each entry:

- **Approve** - Mark ready for merge. In Play mode, triggers an immediate GitHub merge. In Pause mode, entry waits for flush.
- **Reject** - Decline the changes
- **Request Changes** - Ask for modifications with specific feedback; the task gets priority re-dispatch

### Flush

In Pause mode, use the **Flush** button to merge all approved entries via the GitHub API.

## Orchestrator

The Orchestrator view shows a conversational feed of the AI project foreman's activity.

### Feed

Events appear as context-rich messages including:

- **Decisions** - e.g., "Approving 'Fix login bug' (#42) in owner/repo"
- **Feedback** - Orchestrator comments on work quality
- **Escalations** - Issues requiring human intervention, with actionable context and PR links

### Chat

Type messages in the input field to ask the orchestrator questions or provide direction. The orchestrator responds via the event feed.

## Events

The Events view shows a real-time stream of system events.

### Event Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `task:created` | New task created |
| `task:updated` | Task state changed |
| `session:started` | Agent session began |
| `session:ended` | Agent session completed |
| `merge:approved` | Entry approved in queue |
| `merge:completed` | Changes merged |

### Filtering

Use the category tabs to filter events:

| Tab | Shows |
|-----|-------|
| **All** | Every event |
| **Task** | `task:*` events (state changes, creation) |
| **Agent** | `agent:*` events (session output) |
| **Merge** | `merge:*` events (queue actions) |
| **System** | `system:*` events (mode changes, startup) |
| **Orchestrator** | `orchestrator:*` events (decisions, escalations) |

Use the **Pause** button to freeze the list at its current state for inspection.
